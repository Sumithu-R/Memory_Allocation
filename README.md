# Quick Fit Memory Allocation Algorithm

This project implements the **Quick Fit Memory Allocation Algorithm** in **Java**. The algorithm is designed to allocate memory from predefined partition blocks based on job sizes. It reduces the time spent searching for free blocks by using size-segregated free lists.

## Features
- Predefined partition sizes: **50 KB**, **100 KB**, and **200 KB**.
- Efficient allocation of memory based on requested job sizes.
- Displays remaining free memory blocks after allocation.
- Handles allocation failures when no suitable memory block is available.
